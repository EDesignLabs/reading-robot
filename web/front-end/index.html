								<li><p>The space shuttle Endeavour launched from Kennedy Space Center on September 12, 1992.  This was the first time astronauts from the United States and Japan worked together.  But it was important for another reason as well.  On board was a special woman, Dr. Mae Carol Jemison.  She was the mission’s science specialist.  She was also the first African American woman to voyage into space. 
																<a class = "callout record" href = "_REC" data-type= "rec" data-q = "What do you think?"> <img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a> 

								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Mae was born in Decatur, Alabama, on October 17, 1956.  She grew up in Chicago, Illinois.  As early as kindergarten, Mae knew that she wanted to be a scientist.  Her parents encouraged Mae’s curiosity and supported her many interests.  As a child, Mae was an excellent student.  She enjoyed dancing and drawing too.  But space was the thing that interested Mae the most.  She read book after book about the universe and its stars and planets.
									<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "Our parents always influence us, huh? Can you figure out how Mae's parents influenced her? I wasn't sure at first, so I went back and read this paragraph and tried to find where it talked about Mae's parents." data-r = "Oh yeah"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Mae would also lie outside, look at the stars, and think about outer space.  She was excited by the many space missions that were being launched into space.  She wanted to travel in space like the astronauts aboard Apollo 11.  That was the first mission to land on the moon.  Mae knew that the only way to get into space would be to become an astronaut.  She also knew that it would take hard work for her to reach that goal. 
										<a class = "callout record" href = "_REC" data-type= "rec" data-q = "What do you think she’s going to do to reach her goal? I came up with ideas by thinking about what most people do to reach their goals. "> <img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a> 

								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Because Mae was such a good student, she won a special scholarship to attend college in California.  She learned about chemical engineering- the study of chemicals and their uses- and African American Studies.  Mae enrolled in medical school after she graduated from college.  She planned to become a doctor first, then work on getting into NASA’s astronaut program.  NASA stands for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
									<a 
										class = "callout" 
										href = "#free" 
										data-type= "f"
										data-q = "Good job, you’re half way through the story!" 
										
									>
										<img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								</p></li>
								<li><p>As a medical student, Mae worked in Cuba, Kenya, and Thailand.  Later she worked in Liberia for two years.  From these experiences, she learned  a lot about problems facing people on Earth. 
									<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "When I read, I stop sometimes to see if I understand what I’m reading. Can you list some problems you think she learned about?" data-r = "That's a good thought."  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>

								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Meanwhile, important changes were happening at NASA.  In 1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space.  That same year, Guion Bluford became the first African American man in space.  But NASA had yet to send an African American woman into orbit.  Mae wanted to be the first African American woman in space.
									<a 
										class = "callout" 
										href = "#free" 
										data-type= "f"
										data-q = "Wow! To be the first African American woman in space would be such a big accomplishment!"
										
									>
										<img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								After returning to the United States, she worked as a doctor during the day and took more science classes at night.  Then, in the fall of 1985, she applied to the astronaut program.</p></li>
								<li><p>In 1987, NASA accepted Mae as the first African American woman in its astronaut program.  Mae was going to go to outer space!  Mae trained at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for a year.  Then she worked at NASA for another five years before her mission was set to go.  Finally, on September 12, 1992, Mae’s dream of flying into space came true.  For eight days, the crew of the Endeavour circled the Earth.  Mae ran scientific and medical experiments about bones, weightlessness, and motion sickness.

								</p></li>
								<li><p>All her years of study had finally paid off.  On board the Endeavour, Mae traveled more than three million miles and completed 127 orbits of Earth.  More importantly, she showed the world that nothing should stop people from doing what they really wanted to do.
