									was angry with the men who walked the earth. They had accepted the gift of fire! He decided that their punishment would be brought to earth by the first woman. This was Pandora.								</p>
									
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									All the gods and goddesses gave Pandora gifts before she was sent to earth. Aphrodite gave her beauty and charm. Apollo gave her the gift of music. Athena gave her wisdom. And someone, some say it was Zeus himself, gave her the gift of curiosity. Then Zeus handed Pandora a lovely golden box. It had a very tight lid. Zeus told Pandora to take the box with her to earth. “But,” he warned her, “you must never, never open it.”		
									<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "Zeus is like the god of all of the gods. He's the big guy in charge. Remember when we learned about Zeus in Ben's class? That was cool!" data-r = "Hmmmmm that's an interesting take!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
							      Zeus sent Pandora to Epimetheus. “She is your gift for making all those animals for the earth,” Zeus said.
        Prometheus had warned Epimetheus never to accept gifts from Zeus. But Epimetheus saw how lovely Pandora was. He forgot his brother’s words.
		<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "Why do you think Epimetheus forgot his brother's words?" data-r = "Hmmmmm that's an interesting take!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
		
		Epimetheus fell in love with Pandora. They became husband and wife.
							</li>
							<li>
							  Pandora put her box on a high shelf. She remembered Zeus’ warning. She told herself she’d never open the golden box. But in time her curiosity grew stronger and stronger. One day, when Epimetheus was away, she climbed up to the shelf.
        “I must know what is inside this box!” Pandora said. “Just one little peek couldn’t hurt. Since it comes from the gods, it must be something wonderful!”
		
				<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "Do you agree with Pandora?" data-r = "Hmmmmm that's an interesting take!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>

							</li>
								<p>	She took the key, slid it into the lock and turned it. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes and slowly lifted the lid of the box. She opened her eyes and looked into the box, expecting to see fine silks, gowns or gold bracelets and necklaces or even piles of gold coins.
								<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "What do you think is in the box?" data-r = "Hmmmmm that's an interesting take!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								
								</p>
								<p>But there was no gleam of gold or treasure. There were no shining bracelets and not one beautiful dress! The look of excitement on her face quickly turned to one of disappointment and then horror. For Zeus had packed the box full of all the terrible evils he could think of.</p>
							</p>
							
							<li>
							  Suddenly the box seemed to leap out of her hands. The lid fell off, and the most terrible things came flying out of it. Roars, screams, howls, and moans filled the room. It grew very dark. Awful things came out of that box. Some had wings. Some slithered and crawled. Some had pointed ears, long tails, and sharp fangs. These creatures were envy, greed, sickness, and sorrow. They were hunger and prejudice, and evil of every kind.
								<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "You're awesome! There's only two paragraphs left in the story!" data-r = "Hmmmmm that's an interesting take!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								
							</li>
							<li>
							  The creatures stung Pandora over and over again and she slammed the lid shut. “Oh, no!” Pandora cried. She knew she had done something terribly wrong. Epimetheus ran into the room to see why she was crying in pain. Pandora could still hear a voice calling to her from the box, pleading with her to be let out. Epimetheus agreed that nothing inside the box could be worse than the horrors that had already been released, so they opened the lid once more.
								<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "Why would she open the box again!!!!???" data-r = "Hmmmmm that's an interesting take!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
							</li>
							<li>
								All that remained in the box was Hope. It fluttered from the box like a beautiful dragonfly, touching the wounds created by the evil creatures, and healing them. Even though Pandora had released pain and suffering upon the world, she had also allowed Hope to follow them. Hope stayed in order to help humans fight the evils that had escaped from Pandora’s box.

									I'm so excited to learn more about The Ancient Greeks. The things that we learned about them in Ben's class was so interesting. They were good at fighting and they invented democracy. Now we can see what kind of stories they told.
