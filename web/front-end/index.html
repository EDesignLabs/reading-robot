								<li><p>The space shuttle Endeavour launched from Kennedy Space Center on September 12, 1992.  This was the first time astronauts from the United States and Japan worked together.  But it was important for another reason as well.  On board was a special woman, Dr. Mae Carol Jemison.  She was the mission’s science specialist.  She was also the first African American woman to voyage into space. 
																<a class = "callout record" href = "_REC" data-type= "rec" data-q = "What do you think?"> <img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a> 

								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Mae was born in Decatur, Alabama, on October 17, 1956.  She grew up in Chicago, Illinois.  As early as kindergarten, Mae knew that she wanted to be a scientist.  Her parents encouraged Mae’s curiosity and supported her many interests.  As a child, Mae was an excellent student.  She enjoyed dancing and drawing too.  But space was the thing that interested Mae the most.  She read book after book about the universe and its stars and planets.
									<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "Our parents always influence us, huh? Can you figure out how Mae's parents influenced her? I wasn't sure at first, so I went back and read this paragraph and tried to find where it talked about Mae's parents." data-r = "Oh yeah"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Mae would also lie outside, look at the stars, and think about outer space.  She was excited by the many space missions that were being launched into space.  She wanted to travel in space like the astronauts aboard Apollo 11.  That was the first mission to land on the moon.  Mae knew that the only way to get into space would be to become an astronaut.  She also knew that it would take hard work for her to reach that goal. 
										<a class = "callout record" href = "_REC" data-type= "rec" data-q = "What do you think she’s going to do to reach her goal? I came up with ideas by thinking about what most people do to reach their goals. "> <img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a> 

								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Because Mae was such a good student, she won a special scholarship to attend college in California.  She learned about chemical engineering- the study of chemicals and their uses- and African American Studies.  Mae enrolled in medical school after she graduated from college.  She planned to become a doctor first, then work on getting into NASA’s astronaut program.  NASA stands for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.

										data-q = "Good job, you’re half way through the story!" 
										
									>
										<img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								</p></li>
								<li><p>As a medical student, Mae worked in Cuba, Kenya, and Thailand.  Later she worked in Liberia for two years.  From these experiences, she learned  a lot about problems facing people on Earth. 
									<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "When I read, I stop sometimes to see if I understand what I’m reading. Can you list some problems you think she learned about?" data-r = "That's a good thought."  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>

								
								</p></li>
								<li><p>Meanwhile, important changes were happening at NASA.  In 1983, Sally Ride became the first American woman in space.  That same year, Guion Bluford became the first African American man in space.  But NASA had yet to send an African American woman into orbit.  Mae wanted to be the first African American woman in space.
									<a 
										class = "callout" 
										href = "#free" 
										data-type= "f"
										data-q = "Wow! To be the first African American woman in space would be such a big accomplishment!"
										
									>
										<img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								After returning to the United States, she worked as a doctor during the day and took more science classes at night.  Then, in the fall of 1985, she applied to the astronaut program.</p></li>
								<li><p>In 1987, NASA accepted Mae as the first African American woman in its astronaut program.  Mae was going to go to outer space!  Mae trained at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, for a year.  Then she worked at NASA for another five years before her mission was set to go.  Finally, on September 12, 1992, Mae’s dream of flying into space came true.  For eight days, the crew of the Endeavour circled the Earth.  Mae ran scientific and medical experiments about bones, weightlessness, and motion sickness.

								</p></li>
								<li><p>All her years of study had finally paid off.  On board the Endeavour, Mae traveled more than three million miles and completed 127 orbits of Earth.  More importantly, she showed the world that nothing should stop people from doing what they really wanted to do.

									was angry with the men who walked the earth. They had accepted the gift of fire! He decided that their punishment would be brought to earth by the first woman. This was Pandora.								
									
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									All the gods and goddesses gave Pandora gifts before she was sent to earth. Aphrodite gave her beauty and charm. Apollo gave her the gift of music. Athena gave her wisdom. And someone, some say it was Zeus himself, gave her the gift of curiosity. Then Zeus handed Pandora a lovely golden box. It had a very tight lid. Zeus told Pandora to take the box with her to earth. “But,” he warned her, “you must never, never open it.”		
									<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "fr" data-q = "Whoa! Wait a minute! I wonder why would Zeus would give Pandora an awesome box, but then tell her not to open it? " data-r = "Hmmmmm that's an interesting take!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
							<p>
							      Zeus sent Pandora to Epimetheus. “She is your gift for making all those animals for the earth,” Zeus said.
        Prometheus had warned Epimetheus never to accept gifts from Zeus. But Epimetheus saw how lovely Pandora was. He forgot his brother’s words.
		<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "m" data-q = "Why do you think Epimetheus forgot his brother's words?" data-c = "Epimetheus' brother was a liar.,Epimetheus fell in love with Pandora.,Epimetheus did not like his brother."  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
		
		Epimetheus fell in love with Pandora. They became husband and wife.
		</p>
							</li>
							<li>
							<p>
							  Pandora put her box on a high shelf. She remembered Zeus’ warning. She told herself she’d never open the golden box. But in time her curiosity grew stronger and stronger. One day, when Epimetheus was away, she climbed up to the shelf.
        “I must know what is inside this box!” Pandora said. “Just one little peek couldn’t hurt. Since it comes from the gods, it must be something wonderful!”
		
				<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "m" data-q = "Do you agree with Pandora?" data-c = "Yes,No"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
							</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<p>	
								She took the key, slid it into the lock and turned it. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes and slowly lifted the lid of the box. She opened her eyes and looked into the box, expecting to see fine silks, gowns or gold bracelets and necklaces or even piles of gold coins.
								<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "m" data-q = "What do you think is in the box?" data-c = "Something Good,Something Bad"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								
								</p>
								<p>
								But there was no gleam of gold or treasure. There were no shining bracelets and not one beautiful dress! The look of excitement on her face quickly turned to one of disappointment and then horror. For Zeus had packed the box full of all the terrible evils he could think of.
								</p>
							</li>
							
							<li>
								<p>
									Suddenly the box seemed to leap out of her hands. The lid fell off, and the most terrible things came flying out of it. Roars, screams, howls, and moans filled the room. It grew very dark. Awful things came out of that box. Some had wings. Some slithered and crawled. Some had pointed ears, long tails, and sharp fangs. These creatures were envy, greed, sickness, and sorrow. They were hunger and prejudice, and evil of every kind.
									<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "f" data-q = "You're awesome! There's only two paragraphs left in the story!"  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
							<p>
							  The creatures stung Pandora over and over again and she slammed the lid shut. “Oh, no!” Pandora cried. She knew she had done something terribly wrong. Epimetheus ran into the room to see why she was crying in pain. Pandora could still hear a voice calling to her from the box, pleading with her to be let out. Epimetheus agreed that nothing inside the box could be worse than the horrors that had already been released, so they opened the lid once more.
								<a class = "callout" href = "#free" data-type= "f" data-q = "Why would she open the box again!!!!???" data-r = "I've never thought about it like that."  ><img src = "imgs/eye.png" ></a>
							</li>
							</p>
							<li>
							<p>
								All that remained in the box was Hope. It fluttered from the box like a beautiful dragonfly, touching the wounds created by the evil creatures, and healing them. Even though Pandora had released pain and suffering upon the world, she had also allowed Hope to follow them. Hope stayed in order to help humans fight the evils that had escaped from Pandora’s box.
