[EDesign Lab](http://edesignlabs.org) is a collaborative of educators and technologists to prototype new forms of digital learning for k12 public education.  This prototype has been developed through a rapid design cycle, user tested with youth, and built with a focus on educator and learner voices/ needs.  Our goal is to offer a blueprint for digital learning applications; we encourage contributions to this project as well as independent forks that can change the future of education.
